Exercise
=========================
* 1.Coding with operator “++” and “--”,and analyze their difference.

  \E.g: int a = 5; int b = a++;int c = ++a; Print the values of variable “a” ,“b” and “c”;

* 2.Code to implement data type conversion. Print the result.

  \E.g: float f = 1.98; int a = f; printf(“a = %d\\n”,a);

* 3.Input a capital letter from your keyboard via function “getchar()” ,change it into lowercase and print it via function “putchar()”;

* 4.There are three ways to deposit your money into a bank.

  \1)annual interest of rate r1 = 0.36%, keep it for one year;

  \2)AIR r2 = 2.225%, keep it for one year;

  \3)AIR = 1.98%, deposit it twice for a year.

  \Calculate your money after saving it for a year in all three methods.

* 5.Input a float number , round it and print it;

* 6.Input 3 integers, each of them means different side of a triangle, calculate and print its area.

* 7.Float data calculation.

  \1)The radius of a circle is r . Calculate its perimeter and area.

  \2)The height of cylinder is h,and r is its radius.Calculate its volume.

  \3)The radius of a ball is r.Calculate its surface area and its volume. All of the results keep two decimals.

* 8.Encrypt the word “China”. Encryption rule is replacing each letter with the back four letters of themselves.
  
  \E.g: A->E,B->F; Print the result;
